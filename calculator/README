Project 1 : calculator in C

Program Overview

The calculator program will:
1. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Ask the user to select an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /)
3. Perform the requested calculation and display the result.
4. Handle basic error cases (e.g., division by zero)
5. Optionally, allow the user to perform multiple calculation in a loop

Design considerations
* User-Friendly: clear prompts and outputs for ease of use
* Error Handling: prevents division by zero errors
* Simplicity: focus on required skills without unnecessary complexety
* Flexibility: design should be easy to extend (e.g., adding operation)
* Input validation: ensure the operations is one of the four allowed symbols

Program structure
1. Main components
* Variables: two floating-point numbers, an operation character, and a result variable
* Input Collection: prompt and read two numbers and an operation
* Operation logic: use conditionals to process the choose operation
* Output: display the result clearly

2. Flow of execution
1. Show a welcome message
2. Collect the first number
3. Collect the second number
4. Collect the operation
5. Calculate and display the result
6. (optional) Ask if the user wants to repeat.
